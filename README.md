# Smart Contracts, December 5th 2021 (Starting)

Smart contracts are the key element of Ethereum. In them any algorithm can be encoded. Smart contracts can carry arbitrary state and can perform any arbitrary computations. They are even able to call other smart contracts.

This gives the scripting facilities of Ethereum tremendous flexibility. Smart contracts are run by each node as part of the block creation process. Just like Bitcoin, block creation is the moment where transactions actually take place, in the sense that once a transaction takes place inside a block, global blockchain state is changed. Ordering affects state changes, and just like in Bitcoin, each node is free to choose the order of transactions inside a block.
